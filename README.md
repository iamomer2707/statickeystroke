# Static Keystroke Dynamic Authentication (with a Twist)

Hey there! Welcome to **Static Keystroke Dynamic Authentication**, a project that adds a quirky but powerful layer to authentication: your typing habits—not just the characters you type.

Here’s the twist: in addition to timing intervals, we pay special attention to how you use **NumLock**, **Shift**, and **CapsLock**. Yep—those toggles say a lot about how you type.

##  What’s the Big Idea?

Typing patterns are as unique as fingerprints. Even if someone knows your credentials, replicating your rhythm—including whether and when you hit NumLock, Shift, or CapsLock—is super tricky. This project captures those extra quirks to make authentication a bit more you.

##  What’s Inside

- A system that records keystroke timings and special key usage (NumLock, Shift, CapsLock)
- Logic to build a typing profile for a fixed input (like a passphrase)
- A matching engine to compare new typing attempts against that profile
